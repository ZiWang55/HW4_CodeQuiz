### Code-Quiz Website

I created a timed code quiz with the ability to keep track of highscores. Scores are based on how many question you get correct and also how quickly you answer each question.

## Overview

* Created html files one for main page with questions and another to store highscores
* Created javascript files for logic of the quiz, questions and highscores
* Use of localStorage with JSON to store user name and score into highscores.html
